# Made the Sign-In Screen

In this commit/segment we have created the signin screen of our app.

## New Things Learned
- In <Stack> we have screenOptions which consists of headerShown. It is a boolean value. If it is false then the default header (/root/tabs/index.ts)  in  our app will be hidden
- ScrollView component which allow the scroll automatically if needed
- TouchOpacity, it is same as of button in web development and in place of onClick here we have onPress
