# Implemented Tabs navigation

In this commit/segment we have made the bottom navbar for navigating between different tabs.

## Things learned

- <Tabs></Tabs> : This component is the prebuilt component from "expo-router". This make the bottom navbar directly.
- <Tabs.Screen /> : This keeps the component of the tab navigation like icon title etc.
